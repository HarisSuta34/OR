Project Title:
Your project title

1. Problem Definition and Objective 
Briefly state the aim of your project in one clear sentence. If you have made any general assumptions mention it here.

2. Data Collection and Estimation (10 points)
Data Used:
· Room capacities, course schedules, student numbers, building layouts… what else?
· Collected from where?
Assumptions:
· Did you remove any courses, why?
· Did you include all classrooms such as studios and labs ?
· You assumed the number of users in classroom is weighted to the size of the classroom? Or assumed the same weight?
· Similar assumptions here

3. Final Mathematical Model (30 points)
Decision Variables:
Give your decision variables and indexes here with definitions and sets.
Parameters:
Give your parameters here such as distances, capacities etc. (given values)
Objective Function:
Give your objective function
Constraints:
Give your constraints in mathematical form and then explanation. Example:

i∈Cxij≤2 ∀j∈P
Each professor can be assigned to teach at most 2 courses (or use at most 2 classrooms).

4. Model Implementation and Results (20 points)
Solver Used:
PuLP / Excel Solver / something else?
Results (based on full dataset):
Give the current solution for your dataset. (according to current assignment, how many seats are empty?)
Give your model’s solution.
Interpretation:
Compare the two results. Explain what improved (e.g., fewer empty seats, better time utilization, reduced walking). Mention any trade-offs or unexpected outcomes.

5. Validation and Sensitivity Analysis (10 points)
Test your model with different input scenarios to check its robustness. Try extreme or edge cases to see if the model behaves logically and efficiently.
Examples:
· What if student numbers increase by 10%—can the current solution handle it?
· What is the maximum number of students your model can support without violating constraints?
· If the number of recycling points on campus is reduced, how does the average walking distance to the nearest point change?

6. Conclusions and Recommendations
Summarize what your model achieves (e.g., better allocation, reduced walking, balanced load). Suggest possible improvements (e.g., add real-time data, connect to IUS systems). Keep it brief and practical.

APPENDICES (50 points)
Give me the link of your OneDrive Folder, where you put your model.
In this folder there should be also your input files and most importantly SOLUTION.
