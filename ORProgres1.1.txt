Project Title: Classroom Assignment for Scheduled Courses
1. Problem Definition and Objective
The purpose of this model is to arrange classrooms so that unused seats are minimized.
The goal is to reduce the gap between the students planned per session and those
actually present in every subject.
Assumptions:
All courses book one classroom for the scheduled time.
Students in every course are taught in a different location.
The times for courses are set at the start of the semester and do not change.
Course times are assumed fixed and do not change during the semester.
Walks to and from campus are not counted in the equation.
Work areas inside the building are examined first to find suitable places for every
student.
We did not include courses with a combination of students or several sections.

2. Data Collection / Estimation Plan
Data Needed:
Every course and its timetable is available for students to look at, as well as
student enrollment.
Details about each classroom include its ID, the name, capacity
Classroom assignments are is requested from professor for students and
can be checked with online .

Data Collection:
All classroom capacities are taken from the official quota list from IUS (that
professor provided us with).
Program coordinator (professor Ozge) was contacted to get course
schedules or the data will be drawn from the regular semester course
documents.
Classroom assignments currently scheduled will be used for the assignments.

Assumptions:
You cannot change the duration times for course activities.
How many students enroll is an accurate reflection of how many will attend
lectures.
Classrooms should be available during their assigned times, except when
there is a clash with some other course
Capacity of each classroom represents maximum number of chairs in it.

3. Preliminary Mathematical Model (Draft)
Decision Variables:

𝑿𝒄, 𝒓 = {𝟏, 𝒊𝒇 𝒄𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆 𝒄 𝒊𝒔 𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝒆
		𝟎, 𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒔𝒆


Objective Function:
Minimize total unused seat-hours across all courses and rooms:

𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∑∑(𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 − 𝐸𝑛𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 ) ∗ 𝑋𝑐, 𝑟
	 𝑐  r

Constraints:
1. Room assignment uniqueness:
∑ 𝑋𝑐, 𝑟 = 1 ∀𝑐
𝑟

Each course must be assigned exactly one classroom.
2. Capacity constraint:
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑟) ≥ 𝐸𝑛𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑐) ∗ 𝑋𝑐, 𝑟 ∀𝑐, 𝑟

A clasroom can only be assigned if its capacity is big enough for number of enrolled
students for certain course.

3. No time overlap in the same room:
For any pair of courses c,c′ with overlapping times,
𝑋𝑐, 𝑟 + 𝑋𝑐′, 𝑟 ≤ 1 ∀𝑟
4. Scheduled time fixed:
Assignments respect the scheduled times of courses (modeled via constraints or prefiltering possible rooms based on availability.

4. Toy Model (Optional -but highly recommended)
Sample Data:
Course  Enrollment      Time Slot                 Possible Rooms                                             Room Capacity

Math101    30            Mon 9-11am               F1.10 (65 seats)                                                       65
CS102         20            Mon 9-11am               F1.11 (65 seats) 						       65
Eng103       40            Mon 11-1pm		   F1.23 (50 seats), F1.24(160 seats)                    50, 160
	

Solver Results (example):

Math101 assigned to F1.10
CS102 assigned to F1.11
Eng103 assigned to F1.23
Total unused seat-hours: 90.0

Interpretation:

No overlapping courses in the same room at the same time.
Room capacities satisfy enrollment requirements.
Unused seats minimized (e.g., Eng103 uses the smaller room due to enrollment).

5. Next Steps
Finalize data collection with all courses included, alongside time slots, available
rooms and number of students per course.
Slight modifications to the mathematical model if needed to clearly define
every constraint, especially try to solve exam room assignments if
applicable.
Implement model using Python (PulP library).
Test model with all collected data and compare it to current classroom
assignments at University to see if we managed to improve it.
Identify ways to improve room utilization and present practical
recommendations.
